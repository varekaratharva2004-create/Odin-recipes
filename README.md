# Odin-recipes

In this initial project, I will be understanding and practically applying the Git workflow that I've learnt in The Odin project's lessons to work.

Objective:
1. Applying basic HTML skills to build a structurally accurate and simple webpage.
2. Apply tags, elements and attributes to get the desired output.
3. Solidify the knowledge gained thus far through real-world development practice.
